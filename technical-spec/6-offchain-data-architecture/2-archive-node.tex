\section{Archive node}
\label{h:archive-node}

Midgard's archive nodes will store the block data for confirmed blocks.
Security properties are easier to achieve for this historical data because, at all times, the chained header hash stored in Midgard's confirmed state utxo on L1 pins the contents of the entire historical chain of confirmed blocks.
There can be no disagreement about different versions of this data---an archive node is either storing data that corresponds to the confirmed state header hash, or it is not.

We expect all operators to keep a copy of the latest confirmed block's utxo set because it is necessary for them perform their duty of creating honest blocks and avoid the slashing risk for creating fraudulent blocks.
They are incentivized to do so by the fee revenue they earn on Midgard.
This utxo set and the block data stored in the data availability layer are the minimum amount of information sufficient for Midgard to continue producing blocks.

We expect indexers and other professional service providers to store copies of the Midgard historical data.
Midgard's security and ongoing block-production capability does not depend on this historical data, but we expect it to be stored to the extent that users are willing to pay for this service.
