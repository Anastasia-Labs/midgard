\section{Settlement}
\label{h:settlement}

The settlement contract tracks deposit events, withdrawal orders, and forced L2 transaction orders until they are spent.
Each settlement utxo is created whenever a block merges into the confirmed state and includes any deposits, withdrawals, or transaction orders.
The settlement contains the block's deposits root hash, withdrawals root hash, and the transactions root hash (including both the requeusts and orders).
Users must reference a settlement utxo to spend its confirmed deposits, withdrawals, or transaction orders.

The current operator can optimistically resolve any settlement utxo, claiming that its confirmed user events have all been spent.
To do so, the operator attaches a resolution claim to the settlement datum for the \code{maturity\_duration} (a protocol parameter).
During this maturity period, if the operator's resolution claim is proven fraudulent, the prover can slash the operator's bond and remove the resolution claim from the settlement datum.
After the maturity period, the settlement utxo can be spent if the resolution claim is intact.

\tipbox{Perhaps concluding a settlement should also release the user fees collected from the utxo's user events to the operator.
These fees would incentivize the operator to resolve settlements promptly.}

The timestamp in the operator's node in the Operator Directory should be updated whenever an operator optimistically marks a settlement as resolved, similar to how it is updated when committing a block to the state queue.
Updating this timestamp ensures that the operator cannot recover their bond until all their resolution claims have matured in the settlement queue.

\subsection{Minting policy}
\label{h:settlement-minting-policy}

The \code{settlement} minting policy is statically parametrized on the \code{hub\_oracle} minting policy.
It's responsible for authenticating spawned utxos at the \code{settlement\_addr} contract, and also conclusion of its utxos.
\begin{description}
  \item[Spawn.] Create a settlement utxo to store a merged block's deposits, withdrawals and transactions.
    Conditions:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item The transaction must include the Midgard hub oracle NFT in a reference input.
        \item Let \code{state\_queue} be the policy ID in the corresponding field of the Midgard hub oracle.
        \item The transaction must Remove a \code{state\_queue} node via the Merge To Confirmed State redeemer.
          Let \code{merged\_block} be the block being merged to the confirmed state, and let \code{header\_hash} be its header-hash key.
        \item The transaction must produce a utxo at the settlement contract containing an NFT with \code{header\_hash} as its asset name.
          Let \code{new\_settlement} be the new utxo.
        \item \code{merged\_block} and \code{new\_settlement} must match on all of these fields:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \code{deposits\_root}
            \item \code{withdrawals\_root}
            \item \code{transactions\_root}
          \end{itemize}
        \item The \code{resolution\_claim} of \code{new\_settlement} must be empty.
      \end{enumerate}
  \item[Remove.] Remove a settlement utxo if its resolution claim has matured.
    Conditions:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item The transaction must spend a utxo from the \code{settlement\_addr} contract.
          Let \code{removed\_settlement} be this utxo.
        \item The redeemer used for spending \code{removed\_settlement} must carry the same \code{settlement\_id} as the one provided to this policy script.
        \item The \code{resolution\_claim} of \code{removed\_settlement\_node} must not be empty.
        \item The transaction must be signed by the \code{operator} of the \code{resolution\_claim}.
        \item The transaction's time-validity lower bound must match or exceed the \code{resolution\_time} of the \code{resolution\_claim}.
      \end{enumerate}
\end{description}

\subsection{Spending validator}
\label{h:settlement-spending-validator}

The spending validator of \code{settlement\_addr} is statically parametrized on the \code{settlement} and \code{hub\_oracle} minting policy.
Conditions:
\begin{description}
  \item[List State Transition.] Forward to minting policy.
    Conditions:
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item The transaction must mint or burn tokens of the \code{settlement\_queue} minting policy.
      \end{enumerate}
  \item[Attach Resolution Claim.] The current operator attaches a resolution claim to a settlement node.
    Conditions:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item The spent input must be a settlement node without a resolution claim.
        \item The spent input must be reproduced as a settlement node with a resolution claim.
        \item The transaction must be signed by the resolution claim's operator.
        \item The transaction must include the Midgard hub oracle NFT in a reference input.
        \item Let \code{active\_operators} and \code{scheduler} be the corresponding policy IDs in the Midgard hub oracle.
        \item The transaction must include an input (\code{operator\_node}), spent via the Update Bond Hold New Settlement redeemer, of an \code{active\_operators} node with a key matching the resolution claim's operator.
        \item The \code{bond\_unlock\_time} of the \code{operator\_node} must match the \code{resolution\_time} of the resolution claim.
        \item The transaction must include the \code{scheduler} utxo as a reference input, indicating that the current operator matches the resolution claim's operator.
      \end{enumerate}
  \item[Disprove Resolution Claim.] Disprove and detach a settlement node's resolution claim, slashing the claimant operator.
    Conditions:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item The spent input must be a settlement node with a resolution claim.
          Let \code{operator} be the operator of that claim.
        \item The spent input must be reproduced as a settlement node without a resolution claim.
        \item The transaction must include the Midgard hub oracle NFT in a reference input.
        \item Let \code{active\_operators}, \code{deposit}, \code{withdrawal}, and \code{tx\_order} be the corresponding policy IDs in the Midgard hub oracle.
        \item The transaction must include either a deposit, a withdrawal, or an transaction order as a reference input.
          Let that reference input be \code{unprocessed\_event}.
        \item A valid membership proof must be provided, proving that \code{unprocessed\_event} is a member of the corresponding tree in the settlement node.
        \item The transaction's time-validity upper bound must be earlier than the resolution claim's \code{resolution\_time}.
        \item Let \code{operator\_status} be a redeemer argument indicating whether \code{operator} is active or retired.
        \item If \code{operator\_status} is active:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The transaction must Remove a node from the \code{active\_operators} set via the Remove Operator Bad Settlement redeemer.
                  The \code{slashed\_operator} argument provided to that redeemer must match \code{operator}.
            \end{enumerate}
        \item Otherwise:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The transaction must Remove a node from the \code{retired\_operators} set via the Remove Operator Bad Settlement redeemer.
                  The \code{slashed\_operator} argument provided to that redeemer must match \code{operator}.
            \end{enumerate}
      \end{enumerate}
\end{description}
