\section{Block}
\label{h:block}

A block consists of a header hash, a header, and a block body:
\begin{equation*}
    \T{Block} \coloneq \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
        \T{header\_hash} : & \T{HeaderHash} \\
        \T{header} : & \T{Header} \\
        \T{block\_body} : & \T{BlockBody}
    \end{array} \right\}
\end{equation*}

The block body contains the block's transactions, deposits, and withdrawals, along with
the unspent outputs that result from applying the block's transition to the previous block's unspent outputs.
The transactions include both transaction requests (submitted to operators' mempools) and transaction orders (submitted as L1 events).
\begin{equation*}
    \T{BlockBody} \coloneq \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
        \T{utxos} : & \T{UtxoSet} \\
        \T{transactions} : & \T{TxSet} \\
        \T{deposits} : & \T{DepositSet} \\
        \T{withdrawals} : & \T{WithdrawalSet} \\
    \end{array} \right\}
\end{equation*}

\Cref{fig:block-transition} shows how the block's \code{utxos} are derived from the previous block's \code{utxos} by applying the block's events.
The events are applied in the following order: withdrawals, then transactions (with transaction orders applied before transaction requests), and finally deposits.
This ordering ensures that transaction order event UTxOs can be properly resolved and collected after merging their associated blocks into confirmed state.

The block is what gets serialized and stored on Midgard's data availability layer.
During serialization, each of the block body's sets is serialized as a sequence of pairs, sorted in ascending order on the unique key of each element.

However, only the header hash and header are stored on Cardano L1.
This is sufficient because the header specifies Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT) root hashes for each of the sets in the block body.
Each of these root hashes can be verified onchain by streaming over the corresponding set's elements, hashing them, and iteratively calculating the root hash.

\Cref{fig:block-tx-mpt} shows an example MPT representation of a block's transactions.
The $(\T{TxId_i}, \T{MidgardTx_i})$ pairs are the data blocks of the tree, which are individually hashed to form the leaves $L_i$ of the tree.
The hashes of sibling leaves are concatenated and hashed to form their parent nodes.
The nodes $N_{ij}$ are formed by concatenating and hashing their children's hashes.
The \code{transactions\_root} is formed by concatenating and hashing its children's hashes.

\subsection{Transaction requests vs. transaction orders}
\label{h:tx-requests-vs-tx-orders}

To distinguish between transactions applied to the ledger from different sources, Midgard recognizes two types of transactions within a block:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Transaction requests:} Transactions submitted to operators' mempools. These are the typical L2 transactions that operators collect from users offchain.
    \item \textbf{Transaction orders:} Transactions submitted as L1 events through the transaction order contract (see \cref{h:transaction-order-event}). These provide an alternative submission path when users need guaranteed inclusion.
\end{itemize}

Both transaction requests and transaction orders are included in the block's \code{transactions} set and share the same \code{transactions\_root} Merkle root.
However, they must be applied to the ledger in a specific order within the block transition:
transaction orders are applied after withdrawals but before transaction requests, which are in turn applied before deposits.

This ordering is critical for correctly resolving and collecting transaction order event UTxOs after merging their associated blocks into the confirmed state.
The \code{transactions\_root} stored in the settlement queue node (see \cref{h:settlement-queue}) enables verification that transaction orders have been properly processed.

\subsection{Block header}
\label{h:block-header}

A block header is a record with fixed-size fields: integers, hashes, and fixed-size bytestrings.
A block header hash is 28 bytes in size and calculated via the Blake2b-224.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  \T{HeaderHash} &\coloneq \mathcal{H}_\T{Blake2b-224}(\T{Header}) \\
  \T{Header} &\coloneq \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
        \T{prev\_utxos\_root} : & \T{RootHash} \\
        \T{utxos\_root} : & \T{RootHash} \\
        \T{transactions\_root} : & \T{RootHash} \\
        \T{deposits\_root} : & \T{RootHash} \\
        \T{withdrawals\_root} : & \T{RootHash} \\
        \T{start\_time} : & \T{PosixTime} \\
        \T{end\_time} : & \T{PosixTime} \\
        \T{prev\_header\_hash} : & \T{HeaderHash} \\
        \T{operator\_vkey} : & \T{VerificationKey} \\
        \T{protocol\_version} : & \T{Int} \\
    \end{array} \right\}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

These header fields are interpreted as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \code{*\_root} fields are the MPT root hashes of the corresponding sets in the block body.
    \item The \code{prev\_utxos\_root} is a copy of the \code{utxos\_root} from the previous block, included for convenience in the fraud proof verification procedures.
    \item The \code{start\_time} and \code{end\_time} fields are the block's event interval bounds (see \cref{h:time-model}).
    \item The \code{prev\_header\_hash} field is a hash of the previous block header. For the genesis block, this field is set to 28 \code{0x00} bytes.
    \item The \code{operator\_vkey} field is the cryptographic verification key for signatures of the operator who committed the block header to the L1 state queue.
    \item The \code{protocol\_version} is the Midgard protocol version that applies to this block.
\end{itemize}
